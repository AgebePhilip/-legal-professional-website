            <p class = "text">There is a great connection between the legal system and society.
               A society will be progressing and healthy when its legal system will be helping 
               and full filling the actual needs of society. A society where laws are not properly
                implemented, it becomes a wild society where every person tries to overcome the 
                shares of others. Crimes get common. So these systems help in resolving so many 
                issues of society...</p>

            <p class = "text">When the citizens are happy with the laws, and they 
              feel that these laws are good enough to protect their rights, they 
              remain loyal to their country. If a society does not have laws and
               people have to suffer the oppression of mighty people, they will 
               not be satisfied at all. They will think that why they should be loyal 
               to their country if the country is not protecting their rights</p>

            <p class = "text">Legal system plays a pivotal role in developing a sense of equality
               among different groups, communities, and people. Social laws create an understanding 
               in the mind of people that there will be no injustice based on superiority. 
               Every person will have to face the consequences in case he/she does something wrong.
                So this sense of equality keeps people in their limits, and they live on the right 
                track.</p>
